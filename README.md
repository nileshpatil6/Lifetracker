# Alzheimer's Routine Tracker

This system tracks a patient's daily routine and sends an alert if the patient's behavior deviates from the expected tasks. The comparison is done by matching timestamps and tasks, and if they do not match, an email notification is sent.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
